# I'll go with Pink and Black

You've got a web app that anyone can see.  But what if it had better colors??!

You can change how anything and everything looks in a web page with CSS.

With CSS you can:

- change the **color** of the text, the background, borders...
- position things on the page
- change the font of text

## Challenge

1. Look for the `<style>` part in your `index.html`... that is where all the CSS lives.
2. Change the background to be the same black used on http://blackgirlscode.com
3. Change the text color to be the same pink used on http://blackgirlscode.com


Hints:
- the `body` CSS selector styles the whole page.
- the `background` attribute sets the color of the background.
- the `color` attribute sets the color of the text.
- the color code for the black background used on the blackgirlscode.com website is `#202020`.
- the color code for the pink on the website is `#f64279`.
- all CSS rules **MUST** end with a semicolon!
