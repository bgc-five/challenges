# What does "undefined" mean?

Have you already found out that when you click on the greeting, it changes?!?  Give that a try.

It rolls through a number of greetings in a number of languages.

But then... it starts to say, "undefined"... THAT'S a BUG!

## Challenge

1. in the `index.html` file, find the JavaScript inside the `<script>` section.
2. find a way to, when your program runs out of greetings that it starts over again.

Hints:

- pretend you are the computer and "translate" the code that is there in plain english.
- JavaScript has an [`if` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) that lets you check for a condition, and if it is true, only then executes some code.
