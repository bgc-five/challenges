# Put Your Name on it!

You have your own URL on the World Wide Web, but does it have your name on it?!

When you first start, your web app will show
```
by NAME_1 and NAME_2
```

... but is your name `NAME_1`?!?

## The Challenge

1. Edit the `index.html` file and change what's inside the `span` elements to be you and your pair's names.
2. Make sure your app is pushed to Pivotal Web Services and view your personalized web app!
